### VcfPreFilter.1.0.py

This script filter VCF file generated by Process_RNAseq.1.0.py by
removing homozygous sites for all accessions based on accession minimal
and maximal coverage, accession minimal allele coverage and frequency
parameters passed. The idea of this tool is to filter out variant lines
resulting from sequencing errors. Filter are performed as follows:

-   only data points covered by at least "minimal coverage" reads were
    considered,
-   only data points covered by at most "maximal coverage" reads were
    considered,
-   only variant alleles supported by at least "minimal allele coverage"
    reads and having a frequency equal or greater to "minimal frequency"
    in one accession were kept as variant,
-   sites showing at least one variant allele were kept for variant
    calling. For each accession and at each variant site, a genotype was
    called based on the maximum likelihood of all possible genotype
    calculated based on a binomial distribution assuming a sequencing
    error rate of 0.005. The variant calling file was formated to vcf
    format.

#### Options:

    --vcf: The VCF file
    --MinCov: Minimal read coverage for site. [Default: 10]
    --MaxCov: Maximal read coverage for site. [Default: 1000]
    --minFreq: Minimal allele frequency in an accession to keep the allele for calling in the row
    --MinAlCov: Minimal read number of minor allele to call variant heterozygous (between 1 and infinity). [Default: 3]
	--dial: Perform only a bi-allelic calling. i.e Only two allele are possible in a genotype if "y" is passed to this argument. Possible values "y" or "n". [Default: y]
    --out: Prefix for output files. [Default: Pop]
	--outgzip: Output files in gzip format. [Default: n]

each variants site two markers were generated; One marker for the
presence of the allele (0/1 coded) and one for the absence of the
allele (0/1 coded).

![](/images/Vcf2struct_Fig1.png)

Only alleles present or absent in **part** (not all) of selected
accessions were included in the final matrix file.

If groups information was passed to the script, alleles groups were
attributed based on the following rule: the allele is attributed to
a group if it is only present in this group but not in other defined
groups. If no grouping information the GROUP column is filled with
UN value. This grouping value **doesn't have any influence on the
analysis**, it only allows to add colors graphs drawn. It will also
help to validate if the structure of your data correspond to the one
you suspect.

2- The factorial analysis was performed on the transposed matrix
using R. Graphical outputs of the analysis were draw and for example
accessions and alleles can be projected along axis in the following
picture.

	 drawing (in RGB+alpha percentage, ex: red=1:green=0:blue=0:alpha=0.1)
	Optional and dependent parameters:
    --dGroup: If passed, all alleles belonging to groups passed to this option will be removed.
    --mat: Matrix of grouped alleles (with either a GROUP or a K-mean_GROUP column). If a K-mean_GROUP column is found, the
	 filter will be performed on this column, else it will be performed on the GROUP one.

### vcf2linear.1.1.py (python3)

This programs aims at performing a chromosome painting of accessions
along chromosome based on the allele grouping corresponding to the
ancestral groups. The idea is to search, for distinct regions (along the
chromosomes) of the accession we want to study, the probability of an
ancestral origin (homozygous or heterozygous). Because, distinct
ancestral groups can contain different specific alleles, show distinct
heterozygosity levels and allele fixation (du to distinct reproductive
mode for example) such probability is not straightforward. An idea can
be to calculate for each regions, the expected ancestral allele grouping
proportion (based on ancestral accessions) and compare this value to the
observed one. Because dataset can be small and/or representatives of
ancestral group are very few, the expected ancestral allele grouping
proportion can be difficult to estimate.

 This programs solves the problem by simulating ancestral population
from accessions identified as representatives of the ancestral groups
under panmixiea hypothesis. For each ancestral populations a total of 100
individuals were simulated. The same was performed for hybrids between
two populations. At the and of this simulation process mean and standard
deviation of allele grouping proportions were calculated for each
ancestral group on sliding windows of size n overlapping of n-1. Because
the simulation process and access to the simulation is a long process,
we also implemented a function that estimated grouping proportions based
on sums of binomial densities. The mean values estimated are exact but
standard deviations are approximated.

 These grouping proportions were then calculated on tested accessions
and estimated proportion were used to calculate the ancestry probability
as followed.

With:

 ***Hmu***: Mean gX expected number for the group gX based on
simulations on homozygous groups,

 ***Hsd***: Maximal standard deviation value calculated for all groups
based on simulations on homozygous groups,

 ***Emu***: Mean gX expected number for the group gX based on
simulations on heterozygous groups,

 ***Esd***: Maximal standard deviation value calculated for all groups
based on simulations on heterozygous groups,

 ***Nmu***: Mean noisy allele grouped based on simulations (calculated
as the number of alleles not from the right group according to the
simulated population),

 ***Nsd***: Noise standard deviation,
 
 ***obs***: gX number observed for the accession on the window,
 
 ***PgX***: Probability to be at least gX,
 
 ***PgN***: Probability to be in the noise (unknown/additional ancestor),

 ***N(x, mu, sd)***: Probability density function of the normal
distribution for mean = *mu* and standard deviation = *sd*.

-   probability to be homozygous for group gX:
    -   if *obs* ***superior or equal*** (*Hmu* - *Hsd*): *PgX* = 1
    -   if *obs* ***inferior*** (*Hmu* - *Hsd*) : *PgX = N(obs, Hmu-Hsd, Hsd)/N(Hmu-Hsd, Hmu-Hsd, Hsd)*
-   probability to be heterozygous for group gX:
    -   if *obs* ***superior or equal*** (*Emu* - *Esd*): *PgX* = 1
    -   if *obs* ***inferior*** (*Emu* - *Esd*) : *PgX = N(obs, Emu-Esd, Esd)/N(Emu-Esd, Emu-Esd, Esd)*
-   probability to be in the noise:
    -   if *obs* ***inferior or equal*** (*Nmu* + *Nsd*): *PgN* = 1
    -   if *obs* ***superior*** (*Nmu* + *Nsd*): *PgN = N(obs, Emu+Esd, Esd)/N(Emu+Esd, Emu+Esd, Esd)*

Genotype grouping at the window was then attributed based on the maximal
probability and haplotypes representation was performed trying to
minimize the recombination events.

*Options:*

    --vcf: A vcf file.
    --mat: A matrix file containing allele grouping with either "K-mean_GROUP" or "GROUP" columns, if "K-mean_GROUP" does not
	 exists the "GROUP" column will be used. These files are those generated by FACTORIAL (*_matrix_4_PCA.tab), SNP_CLUST (*_kMean_allele.tab)
	 or  FILTER_ON_MAX_GP_PROP (*_kMean_allele_filtered_with_x_value.tab).
    --names: A one column file containing accession names to treat (it is not necessarily those used in the Factorial analysis
	but they must share variant sites).
    --namesH: A two column file containing accession names used to simulate populations. 
    --chr: Chromosomes names to work with (each chromosome names should be separated by ":"). If not filled, all chromosomes will be used.
    --win: Half window size (allele number) around a variant site to evaluate the structure at the site (integer). [Default: 25]
    --ploidy: Ploidy level (integer). [Default: 2]
    --thread: Number of processors to use (integer), [default: 1]
    --type: Type of estimation performed: "Simul", "Binom". If "Simul", a total of 100 individuals are simulated for
     each combinations of haplotype and mean values and sd values are estimated based on these simulation. If
     "Binom", mean value is calculated as the sum of binomial mean at each point (exact estimator) and sd
     value is estimated as sqrt(sum variance at each point). This is not the exact sd but the analysis is a
     lot more faster! If you do not trust this sd estimation, you can choose to change this estimator
     by filling a value between ]0,1] to --prop parameter. In this case, the program will use the
     maximal_expected_value*prop_argument instead of using the maximal sd observed for all groups for probability
     calculation [default: Binom]
    --prop: Estimator different from sd calculated as mean_value*--prop. Value should be comprised in ]0,1].
     A value of 0, means that this parameter is not used. [default: 0]
    --gcol: A file containing at least the a section [color], that define for each group a color (in RGB+alpha percentage,
	ex: red=1:green=0:blue=0:alpha=0.1). This file can be the *_group_color.tab generated by SNP_CLUST.
	--Ambiguous: A 2 column file containing accession names used to simulate populations and their group.
	 In this file we only pass admixed representative of a group not represented in nameH. These accessions will
	 be used to infer expected allele of a group at the observed position. This inference is calculated as followed:
	 a probability to have an allele of this group in an accession of this group is of 1 an allele of the group is
	 found in the passed accession. Accessions passed to this option are not used for noise inference.
	--FormerFolder: Folder containing previous chromosome painting. This chromosome painting will be used to better
	estimate the expected number of alleles based on admixed accessions representative of a group. If only the ancestral
	 group is found in the haplotypes of the admixed accessions (passed to --Ambiguous), the probability is calculated has
	 the number of alleles of the group observed at this position. In others cases, the probability is still 1 if an alleles
	 of the group is observed.
	--sdMult: Multiplier of standard deviation for probability calculation of a segment to be of a group. [Default: 1]
    --prefix: The prefix for output files. [Default: WorkOnVcf]

A folder with the name passed in --prefix options which contained
several files for each accessions and each chromosomes:

### vcf2popNew.1.0.py

This program will select markers for genetic mapping
analysis from a vcf file based on several criteria including segregation
 ratio. It will outpout coded markers as requested by the user.

*Options:*

    --vcf: The vcf file
	--seg: Segregation tested. Several segregations can be passed and should be separated by "/".
	 A segregation should look like as follows: Name:Parents:MarkerCoding:MarkerSegregation:PvalueForTest.
	 With a real example: SimpleDose:P1,P2:Ho,He@nn,np:0.5,0.5:1e-5/Bridge:P1,P2:Ho,He,Ho@hh,hk,kk:0.25,0.5,0.25:1e-5
	 (Ho for homozygous, He for heterozygous)
	--MinCov: Minimal read coverage for a marker in an accession (integer). If a lower value is
	 found data point is converted to missing. [Default: 10]
	--MaxCov: Maximal read coverage for a marker in an accession (integer). If a greater value is
	 found data point is converted to missing. [Default: 1000]
	--WinFreq: Window for minority allele coverage frequency to be insufficient to call a
	 heterozygous but to high to call an homozygous (example: "0.05:0.1"). With the example if
	 minority allele is in ]0.05:0.1] calling will become missing for this data point.
	--MinAlCov: Minimal read number of minor allele to call variant heterozygous (between 1 and
	 infinity). [Default: 1]
	--miss: Maximal missing data proportion in the progeny (Excluding parents) (between 0 and 1).
	 greater missing proportion will result in removing the marker. [Default: 0.2]
	--prefix: Prefix for output files. [Default: Pop]
	--addcov: A tabulated file containing genotype of all markers passing filter is printed.
	 If this option is passed, in addition to genotypes, alleles coverage information is also filled.
		Possible values:
			y: add this information
			n: do not add this information
		[default: n]
	--NoUsed: (optional) A tabulated file containing in one column, names of accessions to exclude from the
	 filtration (based on missing data and p-value) but which will be kept in final files.
	--exclude: (optional) A tabulated file containing in one column, names of accessions to exclude from the
	 analysis and the files.
	--ref: (optional) The reference fasta file. If passed, a tag associated to the marker will be
	 printed in a fasta file. This tag will contained 125 bases before the marker and 125 bases
	 after.
	--remove: (optional) For some programs, marker name length is limited. This option helps you to reduce marker
	 names. By default marker name is "chromosome name"+"M"+"site position". A string can be passed
	 that will be searched and removed from all marker name. This is not necessary if your chromosome
	 name is not to long.

### vcfIdent.1.0.py

This program test, along chromosome, the proportion of alleles shared by one accession, against another one. For example when 
comparing a triploid accession against a diploid one, if the diploid is A/T and the tetraploid one is A/T/T, the proportion of 
shared alleles at the given position is 1. If the tetraploid is A/A/A, then the proportion is equal to 0.5. A pdf of this statistic 
along chromosome is generated as well as a density plot of these values over a given window size. In addition, for each potential 
values (0 and 1 for haploid comparison, 0, 1 and 2 for diploid comparison), a file summarizing the density of this value on a 
given windows, that can be loaded to circos to perform a circular representation of this statistics is generated.
